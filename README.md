# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This project utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to present the weather forecast for a given location. 
The user is expected to give a valid city name and the site will offers the Temperature, Windspeeds and Humidity for the cureent day and the next 4 days.

Please view the 'Credits' section below for the sources I used to implement my ideas. The US and AC below are directly taken from the Skills for Life challenge 7 (FE Bootcamp)

## User Story
